WebAssembly (WASM) has emerged as a powerful tool that extends the capabilities of
web browsers beyond what JavaScript can offer. It enables the execution of code written
in low-level languages such as C, C++, and Rust, directly in the browser, bringing
performance close to native speed. This blog post explores compiling low-level languages
into WebAssembly, focusing on tools such as Emscripten and LLVM.

WebAssembly's purpose lies in its name: it provides a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, which can run in web browsers. Combining low-level languages with WebAssembly allows developers to create more performant web applications, use existing libraries, and port legacy codebases to the web.

## Tools Used

### Emscripten

Emscripten acts as a bridge, transforming code written in C/C++ into WebAssembly. It consists of two main parts: Emscripten itself and emsdk. Emscripten provides various header files that can be included in low-level code to enable the utilization of Web APIs. The emsdk (Emscripten SDK) manages the tools and libraries required for Emscripten to function properly, offering scripts for compiling C/C++ programs into WebAssembly.

### LLVM

LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is an essential tool in the compilation process. It enables the creation of intermediaries and final output code. The compilation process involves two main steps: front-end and back-end. The front-end step converts C/C++ code into intermediate code using Clang (a compiler front-end for the C family of languages), and the back-end step involves optimizing this intermediate code and compiling it into WebAssembly using LLVM.

## Key WebAssembly Concepts

### Modules

A WebAssembly module contains the compiled code from low-level languages. It is represented as a `.wasm` file that browsers can execute.

### Memory

WebAssembly memory is a linear memory that can be accessed by both WebAssembly code and JavaScript. It operates in units called pages, each equivalent to 64 KB. JavaScript typed arrays provide a mechanism to read and write raw binary data from this memory.

### Tables

Tables in WebAssembly are akin to arrays and are used to store functions. Each slot in a table can hold a different function, allowing function calls to be made by their indices.

### Instances

An instance in WebAssembly is a combination of the module, memory, and tables. It represents an active WebAssembly module that is ready to execute.

## Hello World Example

Let's start with a rudimentary example by compiling a simple "Hello World" program written in C.

```c
// hello_world.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling with GCC/G++

To compile this C program with GCC or G++, you would use:

```sh
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
```

Running the resulting executable file displays the "Hello World" message in the terminal.

### Compiling with Emscripten (emcc)

First, activate the Emscripten environment using emsdk:

```sh
emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh
```

Compile the C program into WebAssembly with the following command:

```sh
emcc hello_world.c -o hello_world.html
```

This command generates an HTML file that includes the WebAssembly module. Running this HTML file in a browser displays the "Hello World" message.

## Instantiating a WebAssembly Module

After generating the WebAssembly file, the next step is to instantiate it using JavaScript.

Create a new JavaScript file, `index.js`:

```javascript
fetch("hello_world.wasm")
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((bytes) => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, {}))
  .then((results) => {
    document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode("WebAssembly Loaded"));
  });
```

This script fetches the `.wasm` file, converts it to an array buffer, and instantiates the WebAssembly module.

### Using WebAssembly APIs

The `WebAssembly.instantiate` function creates an instance of the module. The import object is usually an empty object, but it can also include functions or memory.

```javascript
const memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 1, maximum: 2 });
const importObject = { env: { memory } };

fetch("hello_world.wasm")
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((bytes) => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, importObject))
  .then((results) => {
    const { instance } = results;
    instance.exports._start();
  });
```

## Running the WebAssembly Module

Using the instantiated WebAssembly module, you can call exported functions from JavaScript.

```javascript
fetch("add.wasm")
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((bytes) => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, {}))
  .then((results) => {
    const add = results.instance.exports.add;
    console.log("2 + 3 =", add(2, 3));
  });
```

In this example, the `add` function defined in the C code is called from JavaScript, demonstrating the interoperability between the two.

## More Complex Example

Let's consider a more complex C program that involves an add function:

```c
// add.c
#include <emscripten.h>

EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Compile this C program into a `.wasm` file without a main entry point:

```sh
emcc add.c -o add.wasm -s STANDALONE_WASM
```

### Memory Management

WebAssembly memory is linear, allowing efficient reading and writing of binary data. Each page of memory is 64 KB, and memory can grow or shrink based on the requirements of the WebAssembly module.

## Tables and Function Imports

Tables store functions and allow their retrieval by index. You can import functions from JavaScript into WebAssembly, enabling complex interactions between the two.

```javascript
const importObject = {
  env: {
    imported_func: function (arg) {
      console.log(arg);
    },
  },
};

fetch("example.wasm")
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((bytes) => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, importObject))
  .then((results) => {
    results.instance.exports.call_imported_func();
  });
```

## Advanced Topics

Advanced features such as SharedArrayBuffer, SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), and debugging techniques further enhance WebAssembly's capabilities. These topics go beyond the scope of this introductory guide but are crucial for optimizing performance and troubleshooting complex WebAssembly applications.

### Threads and SharedArrayBuffer

Utilizing threads with WebAssembly can vastly improve performance, especially for compute-heavy tasks.

### SIMD and Performance Optimizations

SIMD instructions allow parallel processing of data, speeding up tasks such as graphics processing.

### Debugging WebAssembly

Debugging tools such as browser developer tools and specialized WebAssembly debuggers help identify and fix issues in WebAssembly code.
