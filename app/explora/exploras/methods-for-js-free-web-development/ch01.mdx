title: "The Over-Reliance on JavaScript"
summary: "This is chapter one"
---
JavaScript has become integral to modern web development, but its overuse can lead to various issues. This discussion isn’t about ranking tools but rather understanding the impact of relying too much on JavaScript. We’ll explore the hidden costs associated with this reliance and consider practical alternatives that can streamline development and improve performance.

#### JavaScript's Big Impact

<p>&nbsp;</p>

While researching this topic, I found a video titled <SomeT text="The Lean Web by Chris Ferdinandi" href={"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5CnfIAUmrU&t=1033s"} />, where he explained how the web has become bloated and over-engineered with JavaScript-heavy tooling. He talks about tools like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte and how they bridge the gap between mediocre developers and experts. Well, this isn't a problem for developers—as they are happy to extend the functionalities of existing solutions rather than implementing everything from scratch. However, the real challenges faced by users who experience slower load times, higher data consumption, and reduced overall performance.
It brings us to the hidden costs of using JavaScript frameworks.

#### What Are the Hidden Costs of Frontend Frameworks?

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I came across an article titled <SomeT text="Hidden Costs of Frontend Frameworks" href="https://dev.to/manonbox/hidden-cost-of-frontend-frameworks-5pi" />, which highlighted several challenges often overlooked by developers. The most entertaing part for me was the comments—Some developers supported these tools, while others raised concerns. One of the primary concerns is the number of packages a framework installs, leading to unnecessary bloat and complexity and the challenge of keeping these packages current, as there is always the risk of deprecations—when a tool your project relies on becomes outdated or unsupported. It creates additional maintenance overhead and increases the likelihood of breaking changes.

As we've explored, the over-reliance on JavaScript brings significant challenges, including performance issues and hidden costs. This sets the stage for our next chapter, JIT Compiler Bugs in Modern Browsers, where we’ll discuss the vulnerabilities introduced by JIT compilation and how they impact browser performance.
