JavaScript is unpredictable, old, and sometimes makes me vomit. I don't want to use it anymore. Now, this line is perfect for grabbing your attention, but at the same time, it's false because developers can't live without JavaScript, particularly front-end devs. 

This exploration is about finding ways to avoid JavaScript. When I say "avoid JavaScript," I'm not suggesting using something that is transpiled into JavaScript. What I actually mean is that I just want very minimal JavaScript in the final output of my application code.
